### About me
Most of my time is spent working toward my Master's degree in computer science at the beautiful [UC Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu/). I am interested in cloud-based systems and enjoy developing for the cloud. Sports are my passion, and they entertain me in my free time. I also love to travel and explore new places.
